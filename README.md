# About
PySYCL is an open-source Python interface for SYCL that enables Python applications to leverage SYCL-based functionalities for heterogeneous computing. PySYCL aims to abstract away the complexities of GPU programming and provide to Python users an easy to use numerical library that efficiently targets hardware accelerators. The benefits to PySYCL is both accessibility to the large python community and development towards seamless integration with popular Python libraries, such as numpy, matplotlib, and pytorch.

## Installing PySYCL on Ubuntu WSL2 with CUDA

This guide provides instructions for setting up PySYCL on Windows 11 with an Ubuntu WSL2 enviornment with CUDA. 

### Step 1: Installing WSL 2 on Windows 11

1. Open **Windows PowerShell** as an Admin.
2. Enter the command:
   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```

3. **Reboot** your PC when prompted to complete WSL installation.
4. **Ubuntu setup** will appear. Follow the instructions to complete Ubuntu installation.

### Step 2: Installing CUDA for WSL 2

1. Update your NVIDIA drivers on Windows. Enter the following command to check your CUDA version compatibility.
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```
2. Visit the [CUDA Downloads WSL-Ubuntu](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=WSL-Ubuntu&target_version=2.0&target_type=deb_local). Alternatively, visit [CUDA Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) for archived CUDA installation instructions.
3. Follow the instructions on the website to download and install the latest version of CUDA. For CUDA 12.4, the installation instructions can be found below:

   ```bash
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin
    sudo mv cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.4.0/local_installers/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-4-local_12.4.0-1_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-4-local_12.4.0-1_amd64.deb
    sudo cp /var/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-4-local/cuda-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-4
   ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake git python3-pybind11 python3-dev -y
```

### Step 4: Installing SYCL for CUDA

1. Visit [Intel's guide to build SYCL for different GPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/compiling-sycl-with-different-gpus.html) to find information regarding different SYCL installations.
2. Use the following commands to clone the SYCL repository, configure, and build the SYCL toolchain for CUDA:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/intel/llvm.git -b sycl
    cd llvm
    python ./buildbot/configure.py --cuda -t release --cmake-gen "Unix Makefiles"
    cd build
    sudo make deploy-sycl-toolchain -j$(nproc)
   ```

   > Note: `$(nproc)` will use all available processors to build. Adjust the `-j` flag according to your system's capabilities.
   > Note: If you want to install sycl locally, edit the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to be the following:

   ```bash
   /usr/local/
   ```

### Step 5: Building PySYCL from Source

1. To build PySYCL from source, first clone the repo and setup the build directory
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OsmanAEG/PySYCL
    cd PySYCL
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../src
   ```
2. Edit the CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to be the location of your SYCL compatible clang++ compiler. If you installed it locally, set the following
   ```bash
    /usr/local/bin/clang++
   ```
3. Build the project
   ```bash
    make
   ```
